Today I submitted an update to my WordPress theme Simplixity, which improves how images are handled in posts and fixes an issue that existed while no widgets were activated in the admin panel. You can view and download it [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplixity).

I've already begun working on the next update, which should include an easily customizable `client.css` file, for making quick changes to the theme.
