Recently, a [couple][1] [coworkers][2] of mine and I released [AutoPkgr][3], a GUI front end for [AutoPkg][4]. AutoPkg is an extremely powerful command-line tool that allows IT administrators to automate OS X software packaging and distribution. AutoPkgr extends this functionality by adding the following key features:

* Easy tracking of which specific AutoPkg recipes you care about.
* Automatic scheduled checks for new downloads that are available as part of the AutoPkg recipes you subscribe to.
* Email notifications when new items are downloaded.

It's been a ton of fun developing AutoPkgr, and best of all the response from the community has been fantastic.

Here's to making awesome tools and sharing them.
