So I decided to take advantage of the opportunity to download Windows 7 while I still could, (the beta closes on February 10th), and I've been quite impressed thus far. The installation process was a breeze, and I was up and running in less than a half hour. The performance is rather snappy considering I'm running it in a VM on a 1.83 GHz MacBook Pro with 2GB of RAM, (of which 30GB of disk space and 768MB of RAM is allocated for its use). As for the setup in VMware Fusion, the only unusual step I had to take was to create a custom VM. The operating system that I chose during this process was Windows>Windows Server 2008, (there is currently no Windows 7 template).

While it may be unlikely for me to switch to using Microsoft software, it's definitely worth a free download, especially when the barrier to entry is so small. Get it while you can.
