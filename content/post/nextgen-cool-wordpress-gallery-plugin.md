After about a month of searching for a WordPress image gallery plugin that is both powerful and easy to use, I came acrossÂ [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/). This plugin is extremely easy to implement, and once activated is easy to maintain/update. I like the fact that you can create multiple galleries and group them together in albums, too. It's also a breeze to update a gallery or album once it's been posted. I'm currently using this plugin for my portfolio, (which should include more than a few images soon), and overall I'm very pleased.
