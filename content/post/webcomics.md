I have a confession to make: I love webcomics. I'm quite the comics nerd in general, to be honest. It's possible that recently completing the first sequential drawing class offered at my university rekindled this fascination, but who's keeping track? If you're interested in finding out who's responsible for teaching me everything I know about the production of comics, visit my professor's site [elephanteater.com](http://www.elephanteater.com/). I'll have a few more samples from my comic posted in the portfolio section here shortly. Now back to webcomics, here are a few of my favorites:
