I just completed designing/developing my first [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) theme. It's called Simplixity, (which seems appropriate). I am by no means done with this theme, I've just come to the point where I wanted something to release. I submitted it to the [WordPress Theme Directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/), but am still waiting for a response as to whether or not they'll feature it. I'd like to sincerely thank Small Potato, the author of [a wonderful tutorial](http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/02/19/so-you-want-to-create-wordpress-themes-huh/) on how to build a WordPress theme, for the invaluable information he has provided. Take a look at the theme, (<strike>which is currently active</strike>), and let me know what you think.
