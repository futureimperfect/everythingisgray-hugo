Today I uninstalled [Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com/), in favor of using the [LaunchBar 5 beta](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/beta.html). It was late 2007 when developer Nicholas Jitkoff released the [source](http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/) to Google Code, and I've been hanging on tightly ever since. I understand that the project will continue to be updated, but I've come to my wits end, and am done struggling with the application for now. We'll see how long this lasts...
