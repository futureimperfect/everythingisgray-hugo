I heard about a week ago that someone had done a mockup of a possible redesign for the **American Airlines** website, and the first thing I did was take a look at [their existing site](http://www.aa.com/aa/homePage.do). It's unbelievable to me that such a huge corporation with so many resources could produce such a terrible, unusable site. I for one haven't ever needed to use the site, but a user interface designer named Dustin Curtis has, (which inspired him to create the mockup.) The redesign is visually interesting as well as functional. You should read more about it/take a look at it [here](http://dustincurtis.com/dear_american_airlines.html).
