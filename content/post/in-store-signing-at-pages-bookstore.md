The kind folks at [Pages Bookstore](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=9976738330174778878&q=pages+bookstore&hl=en&cd=1&ei=TsLIS4qpOof2M7G64IEK&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=57.379893,85.869141&ie=UTF8&ll=60.630102,-138.691406&spn=0,0&z=4&iwloc=A) have invited me to do a book signing and give a short talk on comics production on May 8, 2010. The event will be taking place from 1-3 pm in downtown Flint, MI. If you're in the area stop by to pick up one of my short comics and chat with me for a bit. <strike>The promotional poster I did for the event can be found in the [portfolio](http://everythingisgray.com/portfolio/) section of this site.</strike>
