A gentleman by the name of Charles Ying of [Satine.org](http://www.satine.org/) has developed a new 3D CSS visual effects demonstration called [Snow Stack](http://www.satine.org/archives/2009/07/11/snow-stack-is-here/), which runs entirely on JavaScript, native WebKit CSS extensions, and XHTML/HTML. If you're familiar with Cover Flow/Core Animation on the Mac you'll immediately recognize Snow Stack. In order to run the demo you'll need either the _Snow Leopard Beta + Safari_ **or** _Leopard + the latest nightly build of WebKit_. Either way, it's quite fascinating to think that this is all being done in the browser.
