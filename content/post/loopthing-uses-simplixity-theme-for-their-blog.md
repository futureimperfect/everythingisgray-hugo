While browsing through my HTTP referrers I found that an online business network called _[Loopthing](http://www.loopthing.com/)_ is using my WordPress theme for their blog. So far it looks like the blog is somewhat secondary, (the link to it is on the bottom of the page), but I'm honored nonetheless. [Go take a look.](http://blog.loopthing.com/)
