I'm very pleased to announce that [I'll be speaking][1] at the [2013 JAMF Nation User Conference][2] in Minneapolis, MN. I'll be discussing my experience with [hosting the JSS on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)][3], along with any lessons learned during the process, (of which there are many).

The three day conference is being held at the [Guthrie Theater][4] from October 15-17. Hope to see you there!
