How quickly can you recognize a corporate identity? I recently found [an article on GraphicDesignBlog.org](http://www.graphicdesignblog.org/famous-logo-game/) that makes an interesting game out of it. They display a small fraction of the logo and you are to guess the corporation associated with that identity. I knew all but three right off the bat. Can you guess which one's I missed?

I find that the best and most memorable logos almost always pass this test. Number six is a great example, (only a miniscule portion of the logo is displayed, yet I was able to determine the identity almost immediately).
