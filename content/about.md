![Me][me]

Hi there! My name is James Barclay. I'm an R&D Engineer at [Duo Security][1] in Ann Arbor, MI. I'm also a designer, developer, husband, and father. Before joining Duo I was a Tools Engineer at [Pinterest][2], and an IT consultant before that. I'm interested in art, open-source, macOS, software development, and security. I was one of the original developers of [AutoPkgr][3], and I still occasionally contribute to the project. I also work on a commercial Mac app called [TMNotifier][4].

I once drew a trading card every day for a year and posted the images to my [Tumbleog][5]. I've also made [a][6] [few][7] [comics][8], designed a [few][9] [Websites][10], [spoken][11] [at][12] [a][13] [few][14] [conferences][15], built a moderately popular [WordPress theme][16], created a [Trump content blocker for iOS][17], and started and co-hosted a podcast about my former hometown of Flint, MI.

You can contact me via email at james [at] thisdomain. I can also be found as "futureimperfect" on [Twitter][18], [GitHub][19], and many other places around the Web.

You can also download my résumé, if you really want to. ([**PDF**](/downloads/resume.pdf))
