Hi there! My name is James Barclay. I'm a Senior Security Engineer at [Cruise](https://getcruise.com/) and an [Invited Expert](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webauthn/participants) for the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) [Web Authentication](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) [Working Group](https://www.w3.org/blog/webauthn/). Before joining Cruise, I was a Senior R&D Engineer at [Duo Labs](https://duo.com/labs), the security research team at [Duo Security](https://duo.com/). I've also worked for [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), and I was an [IT](https://www.lindegroup.com/) [consultant](https://kmbs.konicaminolta.us/kmbs/about/news-releases/news/konica-minolta-acquires-apple-partner-macprofessionals) before that. I'm interested in art, design, travel, Japan, open-source, macOS, software development, security, and many, many other things.

You can contact me via email at james [at] thisdomain. I can also be found as "futureimperfect" on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/futureimperfect), [GitHub](https://github.com/futureimperfect), and many other places around the Web.

You can also check out my résumé, if you really want to. ([**PDF**](/downloads/resume.pdf))
